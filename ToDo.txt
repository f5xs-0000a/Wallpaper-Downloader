Issues:
1. image_downloader will no longer handle overwriting the queue file. Another function that would be run every 15
        seconds and during Exception raises will handle it.

To do:
1. Transform Level 3 into an object-oriented code that uses a single class (or more) to control all the queued,
   parsable, and rejected links and the domain data.
2. Fix _8chan(). The faulty code is provided below:
